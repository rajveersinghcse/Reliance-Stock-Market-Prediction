💹Predication of Reliance Stock Price Project.


<h3>Hey Folks,👨🏻‍💻</h3>
<p>I have created a <b>Reliance Stock Market Price Prediction</b> project that can predict the stock price of any company for the next 30 days. Here I used the last 7 years' data of Reliance Industries Limited. I did this project during my internship</p>

<h2>Description of the project:</h2>
<h4>Business Objective of the project</h4>

- Predict the Reliance Industries Stock Price for the next 30 days.

- There are Open, High, Low and Close prices that you need to obtain from the web for each day starting from 2015 to 2022 for Reliance Industries stock.

- Split the last year into a test set- to build a model to predict stock price.
