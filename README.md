# Reliance-Stock-Market-Prediction 

![Banner](https://github.com/rajveersinghcse/rajveersinghcse/blob/main/img/StockMarker.jpg)

<h3>Hey Folks,üë®üèª‚Äçüíª</h3>
<p>I have created a <b>Stock Market Price Prediction</b> project that can predict the stock price of any company for the next 30 days. Here I used the last 7 years' data of Reliance Industries Limited. I did this project during my internship</p>

# What we have to do in this Project:
<h3><b>Business Objective of the project</b></h3>

- Predict the Reliance Industries Stock Price for the next 30 days.

- There are Open, High, Low and Close prices that you need to obtain from the web for each day starting from 2015 to 2022 for Reliance Industries stock.

- Split the last year into a test set- to build a model to predict stock price.

- Find short term, & long term trends.

- Understand how it is impacted from external factors or any big external events.

- Forecast for next 30 days.

# How to collect the Data?

- I collected this data from 1-Jan-2015 to 28-Feb-2023. <b>[DATA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RELIANCE.NS/history?period1=1420070400&period2=1672444800&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true)</b>

- You can download the data from the above website or use the Yfinance library to collect the data.

## How to install these libraries?

### You can install these libraries by using the command.

- It can install all the libraries in your system which I have used in my project. 

- You will need Python in your system to use this command. You can use this given link to install python in your system : [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- After installation of python, you need to run this command in your command prompt.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
# Model Building.
- For model building part, we used SVR, Random Forest, KNN, LSTM, and GRU models.

- I was getting more accuracy in LSTM than in other models. So I decided to use the LSTM model in my deployment program or main project.
